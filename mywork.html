                <p>This cinemagraph is a project I made earlier last year. In the cinemagraph it appears to be a picture with moving parts, the moving parts in this case being a revolving door and a car parking outside.</p>

                <p>Last school year in music class we were making rap songs so I made this rap called Life Motivation. It probably took more than one month to make it because I needed to write a script and record audio and visuals seperatly etc.</p>

                <p>At school we had multiple group projects using the studio to create the type of media production we wanted to create. I have a tendency to grab the spotlight. In the Big Bad Cidnapping News-broadcast and in The Sunny show you can watch me in my acting form.</p>

                <p>This is a photo project in which we were given fruit and a camera and we had to make a commercial picture for the Bama company. I added some tinfoil under the fruit to create a mirror effect and in photoshop i made the background dark and the fruit brighter to make it pop out.</p>

                <p>This is a proud creation of mine. It is a CV in the form of a magazine. It definetly represents me and my character and it shows how fun, creative, and yet cool a magazine can look like. This magazine was made in InDesign.</p>
