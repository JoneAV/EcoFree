            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hello there! My name is Jone. You are probably here because you wish to know more about me. I have written this page, so you get the option to do exactly that. In this page I will cover some backstory and I will also cover everything that is necessary for you to get an increased interest in hiring me.
                <br><br>
                I would consider my personality to be described as creative. I have a talent for acting, and so therefore you could very well say that I am a confident and an open person. This allows me to have no struggle with making new friends and colleagues.
                <br><br>
                 I have many things I like to spend my free time doing. I enjoy fishing, training, cooking food and being in nature. 
                I enjoy nature for the reason that it makes me calm and collected. On the more personal side of my free time, I find myself being good at video games, and for relaxation I appreciate binge-watching series and shows, and content creation is enjoyable as well. Watching content creators gets me inspired because I see them doing their dream job which puts me in the mindset that I can get my very own dream job if I just work hard enough.
                <br><br>
                I am not sure what my dream job would be, but i want this job to give me the ability to live financially free. What I mean is that I want to make and earn such large amounts of passive income that I don‚Äôt need to work a permanent job. Investing has cought my eye recently and investing may be the type of job that i am looking. The reason for my interest in this type of job is because it is so well paid, and you can work from anywhere you want. 
                You often hear people talk bad about this sort of job because they believe working a 9 to 5 job is safer because you get paid enough and it‚Äôs easier to do. Well, I believe working that much would be wasting my life away. Going for the easiest options in life will only get you so and so far. I know that for me to do my dream job I first need to understand computer technology and how to accomplish the understanding of it.
                <br><br>
                I want to be able to understand how to code without needing any help. Also, I would like to be able to understand editing software‚Äôs and to be able to edit videos and photos on a much higher level than what I am able to do now. I also want to be better at getting started with tasks faster because I sometimes use a lot of time just understanding the task before starting it which then slows down my overall performance in carrying trough with the assignment.
                Right know I have learned a little about how to code. I know the basics on how to make a well-constructed website.
                <br><br>
                On the photoshop side of things I can edit videos and photos on a good extent. I have among other things made a cinemagraph (a detailed moving picture) with moving text. I already understand a lot and with times I will only get better. I already had some experience with video editing before I started with it on VG1. I often find myself editing photos and videos on my camera roll, and I have editing apps on my phone which I use too. 
                <br><br>
                If I could learn coding it would be very beneficial for me because with coding, I can program things to move, make websites, make your own games and the list goes on. I think since coding is so versatile, it could be used a lot in the future, so its good to learn it because it will come in advantage later. 
                When you have the right skill and expertise, I believe that with video and photo editing abilities, you can accomplish many lifegoals. I really enjoy how open it is and how the possibilities are endless. I want to learn more about it and master different techniques. 
                <br><br>
                Learning to edit videos and pictures can give me the upper hand when it comes to movie productions, content creations, businesses, advertisement, social media and many other things. 
                After I have completed my education, I will explore the world and try to make the world a better place with my capability of both what I have learned in school all together with what I have learned and mastered in my free time. I would like to think that technology is a big thing in the future so being able to understand the principles of information technology and media productions will be a benefit in the future. </p>
